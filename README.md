Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is a take-home coding challenge used to help evaluate candidates
interested in joining the team at Generation.
The goal is for candidates to complete the coding challenge before the
in-person interview so that we can discuss the solution together.
In cases where this is not possible, we may discuss the solution together
over a followup phone call.

### What should you expect?

We expect that the exercise will take anywhere from 2-5 hours to complete
depending on your familiarity with React and with the GoogleMaps API.

We understand that this is a significant amount of time so we really appreciate
the effort you put into it. 

### How should you submit your code?

Any way you want - email us a zip, a link to your personal repo, etc. 
Please include a couple screenshots of the app.

### What if I don't know React? 

Feel free to submit a solution that meets the requirements, but without using React.
React is an important part of our stack and you'll be using it every day so it's important
that you're excited to learn it! If you don't know React and you're able to learn the basics
in order to complete the exercise, we'll be impressed :)
